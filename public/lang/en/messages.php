circa 275 – 285 a.d. - Nicomedia 303). Saint George was the brave knight who challenged
the horrible dragon and, in the end, pierced him through with his spear. The Saint is
associated with honor, bravery, gallantry and generosity.
George was a shining, fearless knight who lived in the 3rd century a.d. in Cappadocia, an
area which is now part of Turkey. His bravery was demonstrated by aiding others.',
        'history' => 'One such story goes like this......in those days, a ferocious dragon lived in a big lake. The
dragon had been terrorizing the surrounding towns and, every day the people would feed
the dragon a sheep to appease it. When the sheep were all eaten, the dragon demanded
that the people sacrifice one young maiden to him each day instead. One by one, the
young girls were killed until, in the end, only the King of Egypts daughter was left. Unless a
knight could be found to slay the dragon, the princess would be sacrificed the next day.
',

be delivered over to the dragon just as many of their children had been. So, the King

blessing, and led her to where the dragon was. ',
        'george' => 'George, who was passing by, asked the daughter what was happening. She told him about
the dragon and begged him to leave before it appeared and killed him too. The knight said to the princess: “Fair daughter, do not doubt, I will help you. Good knight,
go your way and abide not with me, because you may not deliver me”.',
        'speak' => 'While they were speaking, the dragon appeared and rushed them. The dragon was huge,
and its roar sounded like thunder, but St. George was not afraid. He mounted his horse,
drew out his sword and rode hard against the dragon. But the dragon charged him, smote
him and hurt him sore and threw him to the ground.
',
        'sao' => 'St. George did not give up. Instead, he rushed the dragon and used his sword to pierce it
under its wing where the dragon was vulnerable because there were no scales. The dragon
fell dead under St. George feet. The King of Egypts daughter was rescued.

        '302' => 'George was just as fearless on the day of his cruel martyrdom. In the year 302, Diocletian
issued an edict that every soldier in the army should offer sacrifices to the Roman gods.
Because of refusing to burn incense to the gods, the emperor had him arrested.
Diocletian, not wanting to lose one of his best tribunes, attempted to offer George gifts of
land, money and slaves if he would make sacrifices to the Roman gods. George never
accepted the offer. The emperor executed him for his refusal to obey the edict. Before the
execution, George gave his wealth to the poor and prepared himself to die.
